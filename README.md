# Technical Projects

This repository contains three separate projects demonstrating my expertise in software engineering, autonomous systems, web development, and data science. Each project includes a brief description, skeleton code, and instructions to help you get started. Feel free to explore and extend these projects or use them as inspiration for your own work.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Technologies |
|---|---|---|
| **Autonomous Drone Navigation System** | A Python/ROS‑based control algorithm for quadcopters that integrates sensor fusion, obstacle detection, and path planning. Includes a Gazebo simulation environment and demonstrates a simple navigation loop. | Python, ROS, Gazebo |
| **Event Management Web Application** | A full‑stack web application designed to streamline event planning for university clubs. Features user authentication, event scheduling, registration, and automated email reminders. Skeleton code is provided for both client and server. | React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express |
| **Social Media Data Analysis & ML Model** | A data‑analysis project that loads metrics from social media posts and trains a regression model to predict engagement. The example demonstrates how to process data and build a simple machine‑learning model using scikit‑learn. | Python, pandas, scikit‑learn |

Each project resides in its own directory with additional documentation. For more details on a specific project, navigate to its folder and read the accompanying `README.md`.
